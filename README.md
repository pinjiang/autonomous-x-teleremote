As the technology advances many autonomous X ( robots/machines/vehicles ) appears. X connected by ubiquitous cellular network ( 4G/5G ) will enhance their mobitiy to move and execcute many tasks in the real world. 

Neverthless any autonomos system need to be surpervised and managed by humans. A central operation office is likely to host the human surpervisors and operators. 

The communicaiton kits/application/protocol need to transfer sensor information ( Camera, LIDAR, RADAR etc. ) and commands with low latency and security between X and operation office. Here provides an sample application architecutre for building such tele-remote system for autonomous X.
